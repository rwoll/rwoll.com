Hello, there! I'm __Ross A. Wollman__, a senior at [Pomona College][1] in
[Claremont, CA][2] finishing up my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
Some of my interests include [software engineering][3], [theatre][4], and rock
climbing.

Before graduating and heading back to work at [Proofpoint][5], you may find
me walking around campus backwards giving a tour for [Pomona College's Office
of Admissions][6], mentoring in a Computer Science lab for a course on
Computability and Logic, or working backstage on the latest [Pomona College
Department of Theatre's production][7].

If you're looking for me online, you can find me here,
on __[GitHub](https://github.com/rwoll/)__, and
on __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rwoll/)__.
