Well, it wouldn't be official if I ommitted the classic "Hello, World!" post.
So---hello, world! Beginning in January 2018, I'm making it my goal to start
publishing an online blog, so here we are.

I plan to publish a mix of articles spanning my interests of theatre and software
engineering. Some articles will be technical with code, some may be rants, and
others will be more informative.

inbox.](/contact/)
