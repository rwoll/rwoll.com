I've always been inclined to take things apart and investigate how they work---be
it online or in the physical world. I've been fortunate to have many supportive
and knowledgeable mentors, professors, and friends that have helped me to discover
and accelerate my passion for crafting code and mentoring others.

If you're interested in my work, please feel free to [reach out to
me](/contact/). Additionally, you may find some of my work on [__GitHub__][1].

## Open Source Contributions and Interactions

* Here's an example of me opening an issue, debugging it, and then patching it
  in Microsoft's Playwright library: [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1777#issuecomment-618011447).

* Landed a [patch to Google Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/0900dee8e2001c70da70f446a717e99430e87e39)
  to expose download filenames via [Chrome Development Protocol (CDP)](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page/#event-downloadWillBegin).
