I've always been inclined to take things apart and investigate how they work---be
it online or in the physical world. I've been fortunate to have many supportive
and knowledgable mentors, professors, and friends that have helped me to discover
and accelerate my passion for crafting code and mentoring others.

Currently, I'm a Computer Science Student and Course Assistant with the
[Pomona College Department of Computer Science][1]. After graduation, I will be
returning to [Proofpoint][2] in Sunnyvale, CA.

If you're interested in my work, please feel free to [reach out to
me](/contact/). Additionally, you may find some of my work on [__GitHub__][3].
Here's the rundown of various roles I've served and some technologies I know:
